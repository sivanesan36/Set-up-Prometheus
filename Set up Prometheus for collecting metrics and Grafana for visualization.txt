

I)Test Case 1: Installation and Configuration

1)Install Prometheus:

*Choose the appropriate method for your system (e.g., binary, Docker, package manager).

*Create a Prometheus configuration file (prometheus.yml) with target endpoints for metric scraping.

*Start Prometheus with the following command:
prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml

2)Install Grafana:

*Choose the appropriate method for your system.

*Access Grafana's web interface and log in.

3)Configuration Verification:

*Open Prometheus web interface (http://prometheus-server:9090) and ensure it's up and running.

*Access the Grafana web interface (http://grafana-server:3000), log in, and verify it's working correctly.


II) Test Case 2: Metrics Collection and Visualization

1)Instrument Your Application:

*Integrate Prometheus client libraries or exporters into your application code.

*Ensure your application exposes metrics in a format Prometheus can scrape.

2)Create a Grafana Dashboard:

*Access the Grafana web interface and create a new dashboard.

*Add Prometheus as a data source using the URL where Prometheus is running.

*Design your dashboard with panels to display the metrics you want to monitor.

*Add queries to pull data from Prometheus and visualize it in your panels.

3)Verify Real-time Data:

Monitor your Grafana dashboard and confirm that it displays real-time data from your application and infrastructure.

III)Test Case 3: Alerts and Notifications

1)Create an Alerting Rule in Prometheus:

*Define alerting rules in your Prometheus configuration (prometheus.yml).

2)Configure Alert Notification Channels in Grafana:

*In Grafana, configure alert notification channels (e.g., email, Slack).

*Add notification channels in the Grafana web interface under "Alerting" > "Notification channels."

3)Link Prometheus Alerts to Grafana:

*In Grafana, create alert rules using Prometheus data sources.

*Associate these rules with your panels on the dashboard.

*Define conditions for when an alert should be triggered and how long it should be active.

4)Trigger and Verify Alerts:

*Intentionally trigger the condition specified in your Prometheus alerting rule.

*Verify that an alert is raised and sent through the configured notification channel (e.g., receive an email or Slack message).
